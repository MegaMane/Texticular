[Opening Scene]

You wake up disoriented with a pounding headache in a shabby looking hotel room 
surrounded by a bunch of empty cans. You've got a taste in your mouth like a dirty old rat crawled in and died in there.
Disoriented, you roll out of the bed you woke up in, barely avoiding some questionable stains on the sheets, as you stumble 
to your feet sending cans flying like bowling pins in your wake. You bend over to take a closer look at the
pile of crushed aluminum. You read one of the labels: "Fast Eddie's Colon Cleanse: When in doubt flush it out!"
"Side effects may include: Dizzines, vomiting, diarrhea, cold sweats, hallucinations, intense panic, 
paranoia, permanent tongue discoloration, mild brain damage, amnesia, bowel implosion, and occasionally hiccups". 
The can has a purple iridescent sludge oozing out of that's really similar to the shade of purple that your hands are.
Come to think of it, you vaguely remember signing up for a test group that was supposed to try out a new health drink.
Looks like your part time job as a barrista just wasn't paying the bills, nothing like easy money! The thing is you 
don't remember anything about going to a hotel last night, and you definitely don't remember anything about drinking a 24
pack of Fast Eddie's Colon Cleanse. Your stomach starts to feel a little uneasy, but never mind that, it's time to 
spend some of that hard earned cash! You reach into your wallet and realize in that moment that you don't even remember your name.
You look at your license and focus your still hazy eyes and barely make out that it says...<Name>.

When you open your wallet to pull out the cash all you find is a letter. It reads:

Dear <Name>.

Thank you so much for signing up to try out our exciting new drink! 
We hope you don't mind but we've taken the liberty of putting you up for the night
in one of our sponsors hotels with a generous supply of Fast Eddie's to keep you company.


One things for sure you reaaallly gotta go!

Welcome to "A Game of Thrones...Porcelain Thrones"

[Your Hotel Room Description]

As you look around the hotel room you see an old TV with rabbit ears that looks like it came straight out of the 1950's.
Against the wall there is a beat up night stand with a little drawer built into it and an old phone on top. Next to it is 
a lumpy old bed that looks like it's seen better days with a dark brown stain on the sheets and a funny smell coming from it. 
There is an obnoxious orange couch in the corner next to a small window smudged with sticky purple hand prints, 
the stuffing is coming out of the cushions which are also spotted with purple, and the floor is covered with cans of 
Fast Eddies Colon Cleanse. The door that leads to the hallway is to the west, and there is a door to the east that leads to that 
sweet sweet porcelain throne.
